Action: Merging two arrays in sorted order
Inputs: Two int arrays in sorted order (ASC)
Output: New merged array containing combined information of both input arrays


// VALIDATION:
If either input array is null:
    Throw new Illegal Argument Exception

// SETUP:
Create a tracker (countNums1) to count number of elements used from nums1
Create a tracker (countNums2) to count number of elements used from nums2
Create a new array (merged) of size nums1.length + nums2.length

// LOGIC:
for each slot in merged:
    if countNums1 equals length of nums1:
        Loop through remaining elements in nums2:   // This could also be loop through to end of merged
            Set current slot in merged to element at countNums2 position of nums2
            Increment countNums2 by 1
            Increment i by 1 (move to next slot in merged)
    else if countNums2 equals length of nums2:
        Loop through remaining elements in nums1:   // This could also be loop through to end of merged
            Set current slot in merged to element at countNums1 position of nums1
            Increment countNums1 by 1
            Increment i by 1 (move to next slot in merged)
    else:
        if value from nums1 (nums1[countNums1]) is less than or equal to value from nums2 (nums2[countNums2]):
            Set current slot in merged to nums1[countNums1]
            Increase countNums1 by 1
        else:
            Set current slot in merged to nums2[countNums2]
            Increase countNums2 by 1

// OUTPUT:
return merged array
